# Simple Threat Intelligence System

A minimal-code threat intelligence system built with **LangChain** and **LangGraph** for local development. This system transforms natural language threat hunting queries into validated KQL queries for Azure Sentinel.

## üéØ Features

- **3 Specialized Tools** working together:
  1. **Query Enricher**: Analyzes natural language and selects relevant Azure Sentinel tables
  2. **KQL Generator**: Creates semantically correct KQL queries  
  3. **Query Validator**: Validates syntax and provides refinements

- **Out-of-box LangChain/LangGraph functionality**
- **Local development focused** - no deployment complexity
- **Azure Sentinel integration** with 9 security log tables
- **Minimal dependencies** and simple setup

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
User Query ‚Üí Query Enricher ‚Üí KQL Generator ‚Üí Query Validator ‚Üí Final Analysis
```

The system uses **LangGraph's StateGraph** to orchestrate the tools in a reliable workflow with built-in state management.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd simple_threat_intel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the System

```bash
# Test individual components
python test_system.py

# Run the main application with examples
python main.py
```

### 3. Use Programmatically

```python
from main import ThreatIntelligenceAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = ThreatIntelligenceAgent()

# Process a threat hunting query
result = agent.process_threat_query(
    "Find suspicious email activities from external domains"
)

# Get the analysis
if result["success"]:
    analysis = result["analysis"]
    print(f"Tables to query: {analysis['summary']['tables_analyzed']}")

    # Get executable KQL queries
    for query in analysis["executable_queries"]:
        print(f"Table: {query['table']}")
        print(f"KQL: {query['refined_query']}")
```

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Query Enrichment
- Analyzes natural language for IOC types (IP addresses, domains, emails, etc.)
- Selects up to 4 most relevant Azure Sentinel tables
- Adds threat hunting context and time ranges

### 2. KQL Generation  
- Creates table-specific KQL queries based on enriched data
- Includes appropriate filters, aggregations, and time constraints
- Generates contextual queries based on threat patterns

### 3. Query Validation
- Validates KQL syntax and field names
- Checks for performance issues and security concerns
- Provides refinements and suggestions

## üìä Supported Azure Sentinel Tables

| Table | Focus Area | Key IOC Types |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| PassiveDNS | DNS resolution | IP addresses, domains |
| InboundBrowsing | Web traffic (inbound) | IPs, URLs, user agents |
| OutBoundBrowsing | Web traffic (outbound) | IPs, URLs, user agents |
| ProcessEvents | Process execution | File hashes, hostnames |
| Email | Email communication | Email addresses, domains |
| FileCreationEvents | File operations | File hashes, filenames |
| Employees | User activity | IP addresses, emails |
| IAM | Access management | IPs, hostnames, usernames |
| AuthenticationEvents | Login/auth events | IPs, hostnames, usernames |

## üí° Example Queries

The system can handle natural language queries like:

- *"Find suspicious email activities from external domains"*
- *"Detect multiple failed login attempts from unknown IP addresses"*  
- *"Identify potential malware file executions on critical servers"*
- *"Look for unusual DNS queries to suspicious domains"*

## üîç Sample Output

```python
# Input query
query = "Find failed login attempts from external IPs"

# System output
{
  "summary": {
    "tables_analyzed": ["AuthenticationEvents", "IAM"],
    "executable_queries": 2,
    "time_range": "7d"
  },
  "executable_queries": [
    {
      "table": "AuthenticationEvents",
      "query": "AuthenticationEvents\n| where timestamp > ago(7d)\n| where result != 'Success'\n| where not(ipv4_is_private(src_ip))\n| summarize failed_attempts=count() by username, src_ip\n| limit 100",
      "confidence": 0.92
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Consider geo-location analysis for suspicious IP addresses",
    "Execute queries during low-traffic hours for better performance"
  ]
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Tables
1. Update `schemas/azure_schemas.py` with new table definition
2. Add IOC type mappings and field definitions
3. Update KQL generation logic if needed

### Extending IOC Detection
Modify `identify_ioc_types()` in `azure_schemas.py`:

```python
ioc_keywords = {
    "new_ioc_type": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
    # ... existing IOC types
}
```

### Custom Query Patterns
Extend `generate_contextual_filters()` in `kql_generator.py`:

```python
if "your_pattern" in query_lower:
    filters.append("| where your_field contains 'pattern'")
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

```bash
python test_system.py
```

This tests:
- Individual tool functionality
- End-to-end workflow
- Query generation and validation
- Error handling

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Integration with LLMs (Optional)

The system is designed to work standalone, but you can enhance it with LLMs:
