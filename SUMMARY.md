# Simple Threat Intelligence System - Complete Implementation

## üéâ What You've Built

You now have a fully functional threat intelligence system with minimal code that demonstrates the power of LangChain and LangGraph for building sophisticated AI applications.

### ‚ú® Key Achievements

1. **3 Custom Tools** using LangChain's `@tool` decorator
2. **LangGraph Workflow** with automatic state management  
3. **9 Azure Sentinel Tables** with complete schema definitions
4. **End-to-end Pipeline** from natural language to validated KQL
5. **Local Development Focus** - no deployment complexity

### üèóÔ∏è System Capabilities

- **Natural Language Processing**: Converts queries like "Find suspicious emails" into structured analysis
- **Smart Table Selection**: Automatically chooses relevant tables from 9 Azure Sentinel sources
- **KQL Generation**: Creates semantically correct queries with proper syntax
- **Validation & Refinement**: Checks syntax, performance, and provides suggestions
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Delivers actionable threat intelligence insights

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Quick Test
```bash
cd simple_threat_intel
pip install -r requirements.txt
python test_system.py
```

### 2. Interactive Demo
```bash
python demo.py
```

### 3. Main Application
```bash
python main.py
```

### 4. Programmatic Usage
```python
from main import SimpleThreatIntelAgent

agent = SimpleThreatIntelAgent()
result = agent.process_threat_query("Your threat hunting query here")
print(result["analysis"])
```

## üéØ Example Workflow

**Input:** "Find suspicious email activities from external domains"

**Processing:**
1. **Query Enricher** identifies IOC types: [email, domain]
2. **Table Selector** chooses: [Email, PassiveDNS] 
3. **KQL Generator** creates table-specific queries
4. **Validator** checks syntax and provides refinements

**Output:** Validated KQL queries ready for Azure Sentinel execution

## üîß What Makes This Special

### Out-of-Box LangChain Features Used:
- `@tool` decorator for creating custom tools
- Built-in tool invocation and parameter handling
- Automatic serialization and error handling

### Out-of-Box LangGraph Features Used:
- `StateGraph` for workflow orchestration
- Automatic state management between nodes
- Built-in message handling with `add_messages`
- Simple node and edge definitions

### Minimal Code Approach:
- **No custom LLM integration required** (though optional)
- **No complex deployment setup**
- **No external APIs required** for core functionality
- **Pure Python implementation** with standard libraries

## üìö Learning Value

This system demonstrates:

1. **Tool Creation Patterns**: How to build reusable AI tools
2. **Workflow Orchestration**: Using graphs for complex AI applications
3. **State Management**: Maintaining context across processing steps
4. **Domain-Specific AI**: Applying LLMs to cybersecurity use cases
5. **Validation Patterns**: Building reliable AI systems with error checking

## üîÑ Extension Possibilities

### Easy Extensions:
- Add more Azure Sentinel tables
- Enhance IOC detection patterns
- Improve KQL generation logic
- Add new validation rules

### Advanced Extensions:
- Integrate with actual Azure Sentinel APIs
- Add LLM-powered query explanation
- Implement query execution and result analysis
- Build a web interface with Streamlit
- Add real-time threat intelligence feeds

## üìä File Overview

| File | Purpose | Lines | Key Features |
|------|---------|-------|--------------|
| `main.py` | LangGraph orchestration | ~200 | StateGraph, workflow nodes |
| `tools/query_enricher.py` | Query analysis | ~100 | IOC detection, table selection |
| `tools/kql_generator.py` | KQL creation | ~150 | Schema-aware query generation |
| `tools/query_validator.py` | Query validation | ~200 | Syntax checking, refinement |
| `schemas/azure_schemas.py` | Table definitions | ~150 | 9 complete table schemas |

**Total:** ~800 lines of clean, well-documented Python code
